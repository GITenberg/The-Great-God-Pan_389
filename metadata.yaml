description: "The Great God Pan is a novella written by Arthur Machen. A version of\
  \ the story was published in the magazine The Whirlwind in 1890, and Machen revised\
  \ and extended it for its book publication (together with another story, \"The Inmost\
  \ Light\") in 1894. On publication it was widely denounced by the press as degenerate\
  \ and horrific because of its decadent style and sexual content, although it has\
  \ since garnered a reputation as a classic of horror.  Machenâ€™s story was only one\
  \ of many at the time to focus on the Greek God Pan as a useful symbol for the power\
  \ of nature and paganism. The title was possibly inspired by the poem \"A Musical\
  \ Instrument\" published in 1862 by Elizabeth Barrett Browning, in which the first\
  \ line of every stanza ends \"... the great god Pan.\"\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
